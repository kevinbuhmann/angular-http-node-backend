# angular-http-node-backend
Node backend for Angular HTTP service.

Based on: https://github.com/theblacksmith/angular2-http-node_backend

This package allows you to use Angular's HTTP service without importing all of Angular Universal.
After Angular 4.0 is release, it should be possible to accomplish this using @angular/platform-server.

See: https://github.com/angular/universal/issues/264
